## 🏗️ Agent Architectures

### Fundamental Design Patterns

### 1. **ReAct Pattern**
- **Approach**: Reasoning and Acting in cycles
- **Structure**: Thought → Action → Observation → Repeat
- **Best For**: Tool-using agents, single-agent systems
- **Examples**: Most LangGraph templates, SQL agents

### 2. **Supervisor Architecture**
- **Approach**: Central coordinator with specialized workers
- **Structure**: Supervisor → Route → Worker → Report → Supervisor
- **Best For**: Complex task distribution, quality oversight
- **Examples**: LinkedIn's production systems, Elastic's security orchestration

### 3. **Swarm Architecture**
- **Approach**: Peer-to-peer agent collaboration
- **Structure**: Agent ↔ Agent ↔ Agent (dynamic handoffs)
- **Best For**: Emergent behavior, flexible task distribution
- **Examples**: Research systems, distributed problem solving

### 4. **Workflow Orchestration**
- **Approach**: Explicit state machines with defined transitions
- **Structure**: Plan → Execute → Review → Approve → Complete
- **Best For**: Business processes, auditable workflows
- **Examples**: Open Deep Research (graph.py), approval systems

## 🔗 Integration Patterns

### **RAG Integration**
- **Purpose**: Combine agents with knowledge retrieval
- **Pattern**: Query → Retrieve → Generate → Respond
- **Applications**: Knowledge management, document Q&A
- **Examples**: Retrieval agents, ChatLangChain
