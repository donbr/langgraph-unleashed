# LangGraph Unleashed

## Two architectures. Zero bullshit. Pure performance insights.

*Professional analysis by Don Branson, Certified AI Engineer*

## The Real Deal

Cut through the LangGraph hype. I've architected AI solutions across **enterprise environments** for 20+ years, and I'm here to tell you what actually works in production.

This isn't another theoretical comparison. This is **117KB of enterprise complexity vs. 21KB of local genius** - analyzed by someone who's deployed both approaches and lived with the consequences.

> [!important]
> **No Marketing Speak**: Real codebases. Real performance data. Real deployment insights from actual enterprise environments.

## The Analysis

### ⚡ [LangGraph Research Assistants: A Tale of Two Architectures](langgraph-research-assistants.md)

**The truth about enterprise vs. local LangGraph deployments.**

**What you get:**
- Brutal honesty about when enterprise complexity actually pays off
- Local deployment patterns that survive production contact  
- Search API strategies tested across multiple industries
- LLM integration approaches that scale (and ones that don't)
- Performance insights from real enterprise constraints

**No fluff. Just results.**
